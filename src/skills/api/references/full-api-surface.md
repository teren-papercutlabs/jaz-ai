## Organization & Currency Endpoints

| GET | `/organization` | Get org details (returns LIST) |
| GET | `/me` | Test API key (health check) |

### Currencies (via /organization/currencies)

| GET | `/organization/currencies/:currencyCode` | Get by code |

Using the wrong path returns 404. POST body: `{ "rate": 0.74, "rateApplicableFrom": "YYYY-MM-DD" }` (rate = 1 base → X foreign; see endpoints.md for direction details). Base currency rates return 400. See endpoints.md for full examples.

## Advanced Search Filter Syntax

> **Complete reference**: See **[references/search-reference.md](./search-reference.md)** for per-endpoint filter fields, sort fields, and response shapes.

All 28 `POST /*/search` endpoints accept this filter structure in the POST body:

### String Filters
```json
{ "filter": { "reference": { "eq": "INV-001" } } }
{ "filter": { "reference": { "neq": "DRAFT-001" } } }
{ "filter": { "reference": { "contains": "INV" } } }
{ "filter": { "status": { "in": ["ACTIVE", "DRAFT"] } } }
{ "filter": { "reference": { "likeIn": ["INV%", "BILL%"] } } }
{ "filter": { "reference": { "reg": ["^INV-.*"] } } }
{ "filter": { "reference": { "isNull": true } } }
```

### Numeric Filters
```json
{ "filter": { "totalAmount": { "eq": 1000 } } }
{ "filter": { "totalAmount": { "gt": 1000 } } }
{ "filter": { "totalAmount": { "gte": 500, "lte": 5000 } } }
{ "filter": { "totalAmount": { "in": [100, 200, 500] } } }
```

### Date Filters (YYYY-MM-DD format)
```json
{ "filter": { "valueDate": { "eq": "2026-02-08" } } }
{ "filter": { "valueDate": { "gte": "2026-01-01", "lte": "2026-12-31" } } }
{ "filter": { "valueDate": { "between": ["2026-01-01", "2026-03-31"] } } }
```

### DateTime Filters (RFC3339 format — for createdAt, updatedAt, approvedAt, submittedAt)
```json
{ "filter": { "createdAt": { "gte": "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z" } } }
```

### Boolean Filters
```json
{ "filter": { "appliesToSale": { "eq": true } } }
```

### JSON Filters (for tags, custom fields)
```json
{ "filter": { "tags": { "jsonIn": ["tag-resource-id-1"] } } }
{ "filter": { "tags": { "jsonNotIn": ["tag-resource-id-2"] } } }
```

### Nested Object Filters
```json
{ "filter": { "contact": { "name": { "contains": "Acme" } } } }
{ "filter": { "account": { "code": { "eq": "4000" } } } }
```

### Logical Operators
```json
{ "filter": { "and": { "status": { "eq": "ACTIVE" }, "totalAmount": { "gt": 0 } } } }
{ "filter": { "or": { "status": { "eq": "ACTIVE" }, "status": { "eq": "DRAFT" } } } }
{ "filter": { "not": { "status": { "eq": "VOIDED" } } } }
```

### andGroup / orGroup (invoices, bills, journals, credit notes)
```json
{
  "filter": {
    "andGroup": [
      { "status": { "eq": "ACTIVE" } },
      { "totalAmount": { "gt": 0 } }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Sort
`sort` is an OBJECT (not a top-level field). `sortBy` MUST be an array on all endpoints (no exceptions). Required when `offset` is present.
```json
{ "sort": { "sortBy": ["valueDate"], "order": "DESC" } }
```

### Pagination

All list/search endpoints use `limit`/`offset` — NOT `page`/`size`. This applies to both GET (query params) and POST /search (JSON body).

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Default limit | 100 |
| Default offset | 0 |
| Min limit | 1 |
| Max limit | 1000 |
| Max offset | 65536 |
| Response shape | `{ totalPages, totalElements, data: [...] }` — flat, no outer `data` wrapper |
| **Exceptions** | `organization-report-template/search`: plain array (no pagination). All other search/list endpoints return the flat paginated shape. |

**GET endpoints**: `GET /api/v1/tags?limit=50&offset=0`
**POST /search**: `{ "limit": 50, "offset": 0 }` (in JSON body)

**`page`/`size` are NOT supported** — sending them is silently ignored (returns default results).

**Sort required on POST /search**: When `offset` is present in the body (even `offset: 0`), `sort` must also be included.

### Date Format Asymmetry (CRITICAL)

| Direction | Format | Examples |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Request dates (create/update) | `YYYY-MM-DD` string | `"valueDate": "2026-02-14"` |
| Request date filters (search) | `YYYY-MM-DD` string | `"valueDate": { "gte": "2026-01-01" }` |
| Request datetime filters (search) | RFC3339 string | `"createdAt": { "gte": "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z" }` |
| **ALL response dates** | **int64 epoch milliseconds** | `"valueDate": 1739491200000` |

Convert response dates: `new Date(epochMs).toISOString().slice(0,10)` → `"2026-02-14"`

## Platform Features Affecting API Behavior

These features exist in the Jaz platform and may affect API responses or cause unexpected errors.

### Approvals
- Bills and invoices can be submitted for approval workflow
- Only admin users (AP permission) can approve submitted bills
- API-created transactions with `saveAsDraft: false` bypass approval workflow
- Approval records are read-only via API

### Lock Dates
- Organizations can set a lock date preventing changes before that cutoff
- POST/PUT requests for transactions dated before the lock date will fail
- Check `lockDate` field in `GET /api/v1/organization` response

### Bulk Operations
- Bulk invoice payments: Record payments for multiple invoices at once
- Bulk bill payments: Record payments for multiple bills at once
- Bulk import: Items (max 1000/batch via XLSX), invoices, journals (CSV/XLSX import, not API)

### Bank Integrations
- Aspire and Airwallex direct bank feeds available
- Bank statement import via `POST /api/v1/magic/importBankStatementFromAttachment` (multipart)
- Direct bank feeds may create bank records automatically

### Inventory
- Items can be PRODUCT (inventory-tracked) or SERVICE (non-tracked)
- Inventory items have costing methods: Fixed Cost or Weighted Average Cost (set at creation, cannot change)
- Stock can block insufficient deductions (orange quantity field indicator)
- Inventory adjustments via `POST /api/v1/inventory/adjustments`

### Capsules (Workspaces)
- Group transactions by project/workspace
- Move transactions between capsules via `POST /api/v1/moveTransactionCapsules`
- Search transactions within capsules

*Last updated: 2026-02-14 — All search/list responses standardized to flat shape (no outer data wrapper). Kebab-case aliases for capsule-types and move-transaction-capsules. Sort now array on all endpoints (no exceptions). Major overhaul: Added 20+ missing endpoints (bank rules, capsule types, nano classifiers, catalogs, reference data, auto-reconciliation). Expanded search filter syntax with all 7 operator types, nested filters, logical operators, andGroup/orGroup, date format asymmetry. Added cross-reference to search-reference.md. All data sourced from Go structs.*
