# Transaction Recipes Skill

You are modeling **complex multi-step accounting scenarios** in Jaz — transactions that span multiple periods, involve changing amounts, or require several linked entries to complete a single business event.

**This skill provides conceptual recipes with full accounting logic. For API field names and payloads, load the `jaz-api` skill alongside this one.**

## When to Use This Skill

- Setting up prepaid expenses, deferred revenue, or accrued liabilities
- Modeling loan repayment schedules with amortization tables
- Implementing IFRS 16 lease accounting (right-of-use assets + lease liabilities)
- Recording hire purchase agreements (ownership transfers, depreciate over useful life)
- Recording depreciation using methods Jaz doesn't natively support (declining balance, 150DB)
- Managing fixed deposit placements with interest accrual schedules (IFRS 9)
- Disposing of fixed assets — sale, scrap, or write-off with gain/loss calculation (IAS 16)
- FX revaluation of non-AR/AP monetary items at period-end (IAS 21)
- Calculating expected credit loss provisions on aged receivables (IFRS 9)
- Accruing employee leave and bonus obligations (IAS 19)
- Recognizing provisions at PV with discount unwinding (IAS 37)
- Declaring and paying dividends
- Recording and reconciling intercompany transactions across entities
- Capitalizing costs in WIP and transferring to fixed assets
- Any scenario that groups related transactions in a capsule over multiple periods

## Building Blocks

Every recipe uses a combination of these Jaz features. See `references/building-blocks.md` for details.

| Building Block | Role in Recipes |
|---|---|
| **Capsules** | Group all related entries into one workflow container |
| **Schedulers** | Automate fixed-amount recurring journals (prepaid, deferred, leave) |
| **Manual Journals** | Record variable-amount entries (loan interest, IFRS 16 unwinding, FX reval, ECL) |
| **Fixed Assets** | Native straight-line depreciation for ROU assets and completed capital projects |
| **Invoices / Bills** | Trade documents for intercompany, supplier bills for capital WIP |
| **Tracking Tags** | Tag all entries in a scenario for report filtering |
| **Nano Classifiers** | Classify line items by department, cost center, or project |
| **Custom Fields** | Record reference numbers (policy, loan, lease contract, intercompany ref) |

## Key Principle: Schedulers vs Manual Journals

Jaz schedulers generate **fixed-amount** recurring entries. This determines which recipe pattern to use:

- **Fixed amounts each period** → Use a scheduler inside a capsule (automated)
- **Variable amounts each period** → Use manual journals inside a capsule (calculated per period)
- **One-off or two-entry events** → Use manual journals (e.g., dividend declaration + payment)

| Recipe | Pattern | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Prepaid Amortization | Scheduler + capsule | Same amount each month |
| Deferred Revenue | Scheduler + capsule | Same amount each month |
| Accrued Expenses | Two schedulers + capsule | Accrual + reversal cycle with end dates |
| Employee Leave Accrual | Scheduler + capsule | Fixed monthly accrual |
| Bank Loan | Manual journals + capsule | Interest changes as principal reduces |
| IFRS 16 Lease | Hybrid (native FA + manual journals) + capsule | ROU depreciation is fixed; liability unwinding changes |
| Declining Balance | Manual journals + capsule | Depreciation changes as book value reduces |
| FX Revaluation | Manual journals + capsule | Rates change each period |
| ECL Provision | Manual journals + capsule | Receivables and rates change each quarter |
| Fixed Deposit | Cash-out + manual journals + cash-in + capsule | Placement, monthly accruals, maturity |
| Hire Purchase | Manual journals + FA registration + capsule | Like IFRS 16 but depreciate over useful life |
| Asset Disposal | Manual journal + FA deregistration | One-off compound entry + FA update |
| Provisions (IAS 37) | Manual journals + cash-out + capsule | Unwinding amount changes each month |
| Bonus Accrual | Manual journals + capsule | Revenue/profit changes each quarter |
| Dividends | Manual journals + capsule | One-off: declaration + payment |
| Intercompany | Invoices/bills + capsule | Mirrored entries in two entities |
| Capital WIP | Bills/journals + FA registration + capsule | Accumulate then transfer |

## Recipe Index

Each recipe includes: scenario description, accounts involved, journal entries, capsule structure, worked example with real numbers, enrichment suggestions, verification steps, and common variations.

### Tier 1 — Scheduler Recipes (Automated)

1. **[Prepaid Amortization](references/prepaid-amortization.md)** — Annual insurance, rent, or subscription paid upfront with monthly expense recognition via scheduler.

2. **[Deferred Revenue](references/deferred-revenue.md)** — Upfront customer payment for a service delivered over time, with monthly revenue recognition via scheduler.

### Tier 2 — Manual Journal Recipes (Calculated)

3. **[Accrued Expenses](references/accrued-expenses.md)** — Month-end expense accrual and start-of-month reversal using two schedulers with end dates, plus the actual supplier bill.

4. **[Bank Loan](references/bank-loan.md)** — Loan disbursement, monthly installments splitting principal and interest, full amortization table with worked example.

5. **[IFRS 16 Lease](references/ifrs16-lease.md)** — Right-of-use asset recognition, lease liability unwinding with changing interest, native FA for ROU straight-line depreciation.

6. **[Declining Balance Depreciation](references/declining-balance.md)** — DDB/150DB methods with switch-to-straight-line logic, for assets where Jaz's native SL isn't appropriate.

7. **[Fixed Deposit](references/fixed-deposit.md)** — Placement, monthly interest accrual (simple or compound), and maturity settlement. IFRS 9 amortized cost. *Paired calculator: `clio calc fixed-deposit`*

8. **[Hire Purchase](references/hire-purchase.md)** — Like IFRS 16 lease but ownership transfers — ROU depreciation over useful life (not lease term). *Paired calculator: `clio calc lease --useful-life <months>`*

9. **[Asset Disposal](references/asset-disposal.md)** — Sale at gain, sale at loss, or scrap/write-off. Computes accumulated depreciation to disposal date and gain/loss. *Paired calculator: `clio calc asset-disposal`*

### Tier 3 — Month-End Close Recipes

10. **[FX Revaluation — Non-AR/AP Items](references/fx-revaluation.md)** — IAS 21 revaluation of non-AR/AP foreign currency monetary items (intercompany loans, term deposits, FX provisions) with Day 1 reversal. *Paired calculator: `clio calc fx-reval`*

11. **[Bad Debt Provision / ECL](references/bad-debt-provision.md)** — IFRS 9 simplified approach provision matrix using aged receivables and historical loss rates. *Paired calculator: `clio calc ecl`*

12. **[Employee Benefit Accruals](references/employee-accruals.md)** — IAS 19 leave accrual (scheduler, fixed monthly) and bonus accrual (manual journals, variable quarterly) with year-end true-up.

### Tier 4 — Corporate Events & Structures

13. **[Provisions with PV Unwinding](references/provisions.md)** — IAS 37 provision recognized at PV, with monthly discount unwinding schedule. For warranties, legal claims, decommissioning, restructuring. *Paired calculator: `clio calc provision`*

14. **[Dividend Declaration & Payment](references/dividend.md)** — Board-declared dividend: two journals (declaration reducing retained earnings, then payment).

15. **[Intercompany Transactions](references/intercompany.md)** — Mirrored invoices/bills or journals across two Jaz entities with matching intercompany reference, quarterly settlement.

16. **[Capital WIP to Fixed Asset](references/capital-wip.md)** — Cost accumulation in CIP account during construction/development, transfer to FA on completion, auto-depreciation via Jaz FA module.

## How to Use These Recipes

1. **Read the recipe** for your scenario — understand the accounts, journal entries, and capsule structure.
2. **Create the accounts** listed in the "Accounts Involved" table (if they don't already exist in the CoA).
3. **Create the capsule** with an appropriate capsule type.
4. **Run the calculator** (if available) to generate exact amounts: `clio calc <command> --json` gives you a complete blueprint.
5. **Record the initial transaction** (bill, invoice, or journal) — assign it to the capsule.
6. **For scheduler recipes**: Create the scheduler with the same capsule — it generates all subsequent entries automatically.
7. **For manual journal recipes**: Record each period's journal using the calculator output or worked example, always assigning to the same capsule.
8. **Verify** using the steps in each recipe (ledger grouping by capsule, trial balance checks).

## Financial Calculators (CLI)

The `jaz-clio` CLI includes 10 IFRS-compliant financial calculators. Each produces a formatted schedule + per-period journal entries + human-readable workings. Use `--json` for structured output with a complete **blueprint** — capsule type/name, tags, custom fields, workings (capsuleDescription), and every step with action type, date, accounts, and amounts.

All calculators support `--currency <code>` and `--json`.

### Blueprint Output (`--json`)

Every calculator's `--json` output includes a `blueprint` object — a complete execution plan for creating the capsule and posting all transactions in Jaz:

```json
{
  "type": "loan",
  "currency": "SGD",
  "blueprint": {
    "capsuleType": "Loan Repayment",
    "capsuleName": "Bank Loan — SGD 100,000 — 6% — 60 months",
    "capsuleDescription": "Loan Amortization Workings\nPrincipal: SGD 100,000.00 | Rate: 6% p.a. ...",
    "tags": ["Bank Loan"],
    "customFields": { "Loan Reference": null },
    "steps": [
      {
        "step": 1,
        "action": "cash-in",
        "description": "Record loan proceeds received from bank",
        "date": "2025-01-01",
        "lines": [
          { "account": "Cash / Bank Account", "debit": 100000, "credit": 0 },
          { "account": "Loan Payable", "debit": 0, "credit": 100000 }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Blueprint action types** — each step tells you HOW to execute it in Jaz:

| Action | When used | Jaz module |
|---|---|---|
| `bill` | Supplier document (prepaid expense) | Bills |
| `invoice` | Customer document (deferred revenue) | Invoices |
| `cash-in` | Cash arrives in bank (loan disbursement, FD maturity) | Bank / Manual Journal |
| `cash-out` | Cash leaves bank (FD placement, provision settlement) | Bank / Manual Journal |
| `journal` | No cash movement (accrual, depreciation, unwinding, reval) | Manual Journals |
| `fixed-asset` | Register/update FA module (ROU asset, capital project) | Fixed Assets |
| `note` | Instruction only (deregister FA on disposal) | N/A |

**Math guarantees:**
- `financial` npm package (TypeScript port of numpy-financial) for PV, PMT — no hand-rolled TVM
- 2dp per period, final period closes balance to exactly $0.00
- Input validation with clear error messages (negative values, invalid dates, salvage > cost)
- DDB→SL switch when straight-line >= declining balance or when DDB would breach salvage floor
- All journal entries balanced (debits = credits in every step)
