# Recipe: Accrued Expenses

## Scenario

Your company receives electricity each month but the supplier invoices quarterly. At the end of January, you estimate $3,000 of electricity expense that hasn't been billed yet. You accrue it, reverse it next month, and record the actual bill when it arrives.

**Pattern:** Two schedulers + capsule (accrual scheduler + reversal scheduler with end dates), or manual journals for one-off accruals

## Accounts Involved

| Account | Type | Subtype | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| Accrued Expenses | Liability | Current Liability | Holds the accrued liability |
| Utilities Expense | Expense | Expense | Receives the expense charge |
| Accounts Payable | Liability | Current Liability | When the actual bill arrives |
| Cash / Bank Account | Asset | Bank | Pays the bill |

## How Reversals Work in Jaz

Jaz does not have a native "reversal" concept. To automate the accrual-reversal cycle, use **two journal schedulers** — one for the accrual, one for the reversal — each with an end date. The end date stops the schedulers when the actual bill is expected.

---

## Journal Entries

### Step 1: Accrual Scheduler (runs at month-end)

Create a journal scheduler for the monthly accrual:

| Line | Account | Debit | Credit |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Utilities Expense | $3,000 | |
| 2 | Accrued Expenses | | $3,000 |

**Scheduler settings:**
- Frequency: Monthly
- Start date: 2025-01-31 (last day of first accrual month)
- **End date: 2025-03-31** — stops when you expect the bill to arrive
- Capsule: "Q1 2025 Electricity — PowerCo"
- Description: `Electricity accrual — {{MONTH_NAME}} {{YEAR}}`

### Step 2: Reversal Scheduler (runs at start of next month)

Create a second journal scheduler for the reversal (opposite entries):

| Line | Account | Debit | Credit |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Accrued Expenses | $3,000 | |
| 2 | Utilities Expense | | $3,000 |

**Scheduler settings:**
- Frequency: Monthly
- Start date: 2025-02-01 (first day after first accrual)
- **End date: 2025-04-01** — one month after the accrual scheduler's end date
- Capsule: same capsule — "Q1 2025 Electricity — PowerCo"
- Description: `Reversal of electricity accrual — {{MONTH_NAME}} {{YEAR}}`

This clears each month's accrual so the actual bill can be recorded cleanly.

### Step 3: Actual Bill (when received — e.g., Mar 15)

Create a bill to the electricity supplier for the actual amount (which may differ from the estimate):

- Bill: Dr Utilities Expense $9,200 / Cr AP $9,200
- Assign to the same capsule

The net effect per month:
- Each month's P&L shows the estimated expense (accrual)
- Each reversal clears the accrual at the start of the next month
- The bill captures the full actual amount when it arrives

## Capsule Structure

**Capsule:** "Q1 2025 Electricity — PowerCo"
**Capsule Type:** "Accrued Expenses"

Contents:
- 3 accrual journals — generated by the accrual scheduler (one per month-end)
- 3 reversal journals — generated by the reversal scheduler (one at start of next month)
- 1 supplier bill (when received)
- **Total entries:** 7

## Worked Example

**Setup:**
- Create capsule "Q1 2025 Electricity — PowerCo" with type "Accrued Expenses"
- Create accrual scheduler (Dr Utilities $3,000 / Cr Accrued $3,000) — monthly, end date Mar 31, assign to capsule
- Create reversal scheduler (Dr Accrued $3,000 / Cr Utilities $3,000) — monthly, end date Apr 1, assign to capsule

**Jan 31, 2025 — auto-generated by accrual scheduler:**
- Dr Utilities Expense $3,000 / Cr Accrued Expenses $3,000
- P&L: Utilities Expense $3,000

**Feb 1, 2025 — auto-generated by reversal scheduler:**
- Dr Accrued Expenses $3,000 / Cr Utilities Expense $3,000
- Accrued balance cleared to $0

**Feb 28, 2025 — auto-generated by accrual scheduler:**
- Dr Utilities Expense $3,000 / Cr Accrued Expenses $3,000

**Mar 1, 2025 — auto-generated by reversal scheduler:**
- Dr Accrued Expenses $3,000 / Cr Utilities Expense $3,000

**Mar 15, 2025 — Actual bill received:**
- Create bill: $9,200 to PowerCo, coded to Utilities Expense
- Assign to same capsule
- Pay bill when due

**Mar 31, 2025 — auto-generated by accrual scheduler (final):**
- Dr Utilities Expense $3,000 / Cr Accrued Expenses $3,000

**Apr 1, 2025 — auto-generated by reversal scheduler (final):**
- Dr Accrued Expenses $3,000 / Cr Utilities Expense $3,000

**P&L impact per month:**
- January: $3,000 (accrual, not yet reversed)
- February: −$3,000 (reversal) + $3,000 (new accrual) = net $0 change
- March: −$3,000 (reversal) + $9,200 (bill) + $3,000 (accrual) = net $9,200

## Enrichment Suggestions

| Enrichment | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Tracking Tag | "Utilities" | Filter all utility-related transactions |
| Nano Classifier | Department → "Operations" | Attribute to responsible department |
| Custom Field | "Supplier Account #" → "PWR-88201" | Record the utility account number |

---

## Verification

1. **Group General Ledger by Capsule** → "Q1 2025 Electricity — PowerCo" shows all 7 entries. Accrued Expenses should net to zero after all reversals.
2. **Trial Balance at Jan 31** → Accrued Expenses shows $3,000 credit (liability exists). Utilities Expense shows $3,000.
3. **Trial Balance at Mar 31 (after bill)** → Accrued Expenses shows $3,100 credit (March accrual not yet reversed). Utilities Expense reflects year-to-date charges.
4. **Trial Balance at Apr 1 (after reversal)** → Accrued Expenses shows $0 (all cleared).

## Variations

**One-off accrual (no scheduler):** For a single accrual-reversal pair (e.g., a year-end audit adjustment), create two manual journals instead of schedulers — one accrual journal at Dec 31 and one reversal journal at Jan 1. Both go in the same capsule.

**Variable estimate amounts:** If the monthly estimate changes (e.g., $3,000 in Jan, $3,100 in Feb), schedulers won't work since they produce fixed amounts. Use manual journals for each accrual and reversal instead, all in the same capsule.

**No reversal method:** Some companies accrue at month-end and only reverse when the actual bill arrives (instead of reversing at the start of each month). This is simpler but less granular in monthly P&L. Use one accrual scheduler with an end date, and a single manual reversal journal when the bill comes.

**Known amount, unknown timing:** If you know the quarterly bill is always ~$9,000 but don't know the exact date, set the scheduler end dates to your best estimate. Adjust by deleting or adding manual journals in the capsule if timing shifts.
