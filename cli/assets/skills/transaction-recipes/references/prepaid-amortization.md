# Recipe: Prepaid Amortization

## Scenario

Your company pays $12,000 upfront for annual office insurance (Jan 1 to Dec 31, 2025). The full amount is an asset on day one, then recognized as an expense evenly over 12 months at $1,000/month.

**Pattern:** Scheduler + capsule (fixed monthly amount)

## Accounts Involved

| Account | Type | Subtype | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| Prepaid Insurance | Asset | Current Asset | Holds the unamortized balance |
| Insurance Expense | Expense | Expense | Receives monthly amortization |
| Cash / Bank Account | Asset | Bank | Pays the premium |
| Accounts Payable | Liability | Current Liability | If recorded as a bill first |

---

## Journal Entries

### Step 1: Record the Initial Payment

**Option A — Bill (with or without payment):**

Create a bill to the insurance supplier for $12,000 with the line item coded to **Prepaid Insurance** (not Insurance Expense). Record payment on the bill when ready.

**Option B — Cash-out entry:**

| Line | Account | Debit | Credit |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Prepaid Insurance | $12,000 | |
| 2 | Cash / Bank Account | | $12,000 |

### Step 2: Monthly Amortization (Scheduler)

Create a journal scheduler that runs monthly for 12 periods:

| Line | Account | Debit | Credit |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Insurance Expense | $1,000 | |
| 2 | Prepaid Insurance | | $1,000 |

**Scheduler settings:**
- Frequency: Monthly
- Start date: 2025-01-31 (end of first month)
- **End date: 2025-12-31** — the end date is what ensures the prepaid balance fully unwinds to zero. After the 12th entry, the scheduler stops and the Prepaid Insurance account is cleared.
- Capsule: "FY2025 Office Insurance"
- Description: `Insurance amortization — {{MONTH_NAME}} {{YEAR}}`

---

## Capsule Structure

**Capsule:** "FY2025 Office Insurance"
**Capsule Type:** "Prepaid Expenses"

Contents:
- 1 bill (or cash-out entry) — the initial $12,000 payment
- 12 journal entries — generated by the scheduler ($1,000/month)
- **Total entries:** 13

## Worked Example

**Setup (Jan 1, 2025):**
- Record bill: Dr Prepaid Insurance $12,000 / Cr AP $12,000
- Pay bill: Dr AP $12,000 / Cr Cash $12,000
- Assign bill to capsule "FY2025 Office Insurance"
- Create scheduler with same capsule

**Month 1 (Jan 31, 2025) — auto-generated:**
- Dr Insurance Expense $1,000 / Cr Prepaid Insurance $1,000
- Prepaid balance: $11,000

**Month 6 (Jun 30, 2025) — auto-generated:**
- Dr Insurance Expense $1,000 / Cr Prepaid Insurance $1,000
- Prepaid balance: $6,000

**Month 12 (Dec 31, 2025) — auto-generated:**
- Dr Insurance Expense $1,000 / Cr Prepaid Insurance $1,000
- Prepaid balance: $0

**Year-end totals:**
- Insurance Expense P&L: $12,000
- Prepaid Insurance balance: $0
- Cash reduced by: $12,000

## Enrichment Suggestions

| Enrichment | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Tracking Tag | "Insurance" | Filter all insurance-related transactions in reports |
| Nano Classifier | Department → "Operations" | Break down by department on each journal line |
| Custom Field | "Policy Number" → "POL-2025-001" | Record the insurer's reference on the bill |

Set the tag and nano classifier on the scheduler — all 12 generated journals inherit them automatically. The custom field goes on the initial bill only (not available on schedulers).

---

## Verification

1. **Group General Ledger by Capsule** → "FY2025 Office Insurance" should show all 13 entries (1 bill + 12 journals) with a net zero balance across Prepaid Insurance.
2. **Trial Balance at Dec 31** → Prepaid Insurance balance should be $0. Insurance Expense should show $12,000.
3. **Trial Balance at Jun 30** → Prepaid Insurance balance should be $6,000. Insurance Expense should show $6,000.
4. **Filter by "Insurance" tag** → Shows all entries across the org tagged with Insurance.

## Variations

**Quarterly amortization:** $3,000/quarter for 4 quarters. Change scheduler frequency to quarterly.

**Partial first period:** If insurance starts Feb 15, prorate the first month ($12,000 / 365 × 14 days = ~$460), then $1,000/month for remaining months. Use a manual journal for the partial first period, then a scheduler for the remaining full months — both in the same capsule.

**Multi-currency:** If the premium is in USD but your base currency is SGD, record the bill using the `currency: { sourceCurrency: "USD" }` field. The monthly amortization journals should be in SGD at the rate locked on the bill date.

**Renewal:** Create a new capsule for the next year's policy ("FY2026 Office Insurance") with its own bill and scheduler. Do not reuse the old capsule.
