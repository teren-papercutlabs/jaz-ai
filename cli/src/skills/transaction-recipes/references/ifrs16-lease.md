# Recipe: IFRS 16 Lease

## Scenario

Your company signs a 3-year office lease at $5,000/month. Under IFRS 16, you must recognize a right-of-use (ROU) asset and a lease liability at the present value of all lease payments, then depreciate the ROU asset and unwind the lease liability over the lease term.

**Pattern:** Hybrid — native fixed asset (straight-line ROU depreciation) + manual journals (liability unwinding) + capsule

**Why hybrid:** The ROU asset depreciates at a fixed monthly amount (straight-line), which Jaz handles natively via its fixed asset register. The lease liability unwinding has a changing interest component each month, requiring manual journals.

## Accounts Involved

| Account | Type | Subtype | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| Right-of-Use Asset | Asset | Non-Current Asset | The capitalized lease value |
| Lease Liability | Liability | Non-Current Liability | Long-term lease obligation |
| Lease Liability (Current) | Liability | Current Liability | Portion due within 12 months |
| Interest Expense — Leases | Expense | Expense | Monthly lease interest (liability unwinding) |
| Depreciation Expense — ROU | Expense | Expense | Monthly ROU depreciation (auto via FA) |
| Accumulated Depreciation — ROU | Asset | Non-Current Asset | Contra-asset for ROU (auto via FA) |
| Cash / Bank Account | Asset | Bank | Monthly lease payments |

> **Note on current/non-current split:** For simplicity, this recipe uses a single Lease Liability account. Reclassify the next 12 months' liability portion as current at each reporting date if required.

## Step-by-Step

### Step 0: Calculate Present Value

**Lease terms:**
- Monthly payment: $5,000
- Term: 36 months
- Discount rate: 5% annual (incremental borrowing rate)
- Monthly rate: 5% / 12 = 0.4167%

**PV formula:**
```
PV = PMT × [1 − (1 + r)^−n] / r
PV = 5,000 × [1 − 1.004167^−36] / 0.004167
PV = 5,000 × [1 − 0.8614] / 0.004167
PV = 5,000 × 33.2590
PV = $166,295
```

### Step 1: Initial Recognition (Lease Commencement Date)

| Line | Account | Debit | Credit |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Right-of-Use Asset | $166,295 | |
| 2 | Lease Liability | | $166,295 |

Assign this journal to the capsule.

### Step 2: Register ROU as Fixed Asset (Automated Depreciation)

Register the ROU asset in Jaz's fixed asset register:
- **Asset name:** "Office Lease — ROU Asset"
- **Cost:** $166,295
- **Salvage value:** $0
- **Useful life:** 36 months
- **Depreciation method:** Straight-line (Jaz native)
- **Monthly depreciation:** $166,295 / 36 = **$4,619.31/month**

Jaz will auto-post monthly:
| Line | Account | Debit | Credit |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Depreciation Expense — ROU | $4,619.31 | |
| 2 | Accumulated Depreciation — ROU | | $4,619.31 |

> You do NOT need to create a scheduler or manual journals for depreciation — the fixed asset register handles it.

### Step 3: Monthly Lease Payment (Manual Journal — each month)

Each $5,000 payment splits between interest (expense) and principal (liability reduction):

| Line | Account | Debit | Credit |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Lease Liability | *principal portion* | |
| 2 | Interest Expense — Leases | *interest portion* | |
| 3 | Cash / Bank Account | | $5,000 |

**Calculation per month:**
- Interest = Outstanding liability × 0.004167
- Principal = $5,000 − Interest
- New liability = Outstanding liability − Principal

## Capsule Structure

**Capsule:** "Office Lease 2025–2028 — 123 Main St"
**Capsule Type:** "Lease Accounting (IFRS 16)"

Contents:
- 1 initial recognition journal (ROU asset + lease liability)
- 36 monthly payment journals (manual — interest changes each month)
- 36 monthly depreciation entries (auto-generated by fixed asset register — these appear in the ledger but aren't manually created)
- **Manually created entries:** 37

> The fixed asset depreciation entries are not assigned to the capsule automatically. Group the General Ledger by the ROU asset account alongside the capsule view for a complete picture.

## Worked Example

### Amortization Table (first 6 months + last 2)

| Month | Opening Liability | Interest (0.4167%) | Principal | Closing Liability |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | $166,295.00 | $692.90 | $4,307.10 | $161,987.90 |
| 2 | $161,987.90 | $674.95 | $4,325.05 | $157,662.85 |
| 3 | $157,662.85 | $656.93 | $4,343.07 | $153,319.78 |
| 4 | $153,319.78 | $638.83 | $4,361.17 | $148,958.61 |
| 5 | $148,958.61 | $620.66 | $4,379.34 | $144,579.27 |
| 6 | $144,579.27 | $602.41 | $4,397.59 | $140,181.68 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 35 | $9,959.33 | $41.50 | $4,958.50 | $5,000.83 |
| 36 | $5,000.83 | $20.84 | $4,979.16 | $0.00* |

> *Final payment may need a small rounding adjustment to close the liability exactly to zero.

**Month 1 journal entry (manual):**
- Dr Lease Liability $4,307.10
- Dr Interest Expense — Leases $692.90
- Cr Cash $5,000.00
- Description: "Lease payment — Month 1 of 36 (123 Main St)"
- Assign to capsule

**Month 1 depreciation (automatic — posted by Jaz FA register):**
- Dr Depreciation Expense — ROU $4,619.31
- Cr Accumulated Depreciation — ROU $4,619.31

**P&L impact — Month 1:**
- Interest expense: $692.90
- Depreciation expense: $4,619.31
- **Total P&L charge: $5,312.21** (higher than the $5,000 cash payment — this is the IFRS 16 front-loading effect)

### Summary Over 36 Months

| Item | Total |
|---|---|
| Total cash payments | $180,000 (36 × $5,000) |
| Total interest expense | $13,705 |
| Total depreciation expense | $166,295 |
| **Total P&L impact** | **$180,000** |
| Lease liability at end | $0 |
| ROU asset net book value at end | $0 |

## Enrichment Suggestions

| Enrichment | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Tracking Tag | "Office Lease" | Filter all lease-related transactions |
| Nano Classifier | Property → "123 Main St" | Break down by property if multiple leases |
| Custom Field | "Lease Contract #" → "LS-2025-007" | Record the lease agreement reference |

---

## Verification

1. **Group General Ledger by Capsule** → Shows initial recognition + all 36 payment journals. Lease Liability should start at $166,295 and reduce to $0.
2. **Trial Balance at any date** → Lease Liability balance should match the "Closing Liability" column for that month.
3. **ROU Asset** → Net book value = $166,295 − (months elapsed × $4,619.31). Should reach $0 at month 36.
4. **P&L Year 1** → Interest Expense ≈ $7,790 (sum of months 1–12). Depreciation ≈ $55,432 (12 × $4,619.31). Total ≈ $63,222.
5. **Balance Sheet check** → ROU Asset (net of accumulated depreciation) + Lease Liability should both trend toward zero over 36 months.

## Variations

**Different discount rate:** Changing the rate changes the PV, the ROU asset value, the monthly depreciation, and the interest/principal split. Recalculate the entire amortization table.

**Lease modification (rent increase):** If rent increases from $5,000 to $5,500 at month 13:
1. Recalculate PV of remaining 24 payments at $5,500 using the revised rate
2. Record a remeasurement journal: Dr ROU Asset / Cr Lease Liability (for the increase)
3. Update the fixed asset cost and recalculate depreciation over the remaining 24 months
4. Continue with new amortization table for months 13–36

**Short-term lease exemption:** Leases ≤ 12 months can be expensed directly (Dr Rent Expense / Cr Cash) — no ROU or liability needed. Not in scope for this recipe.

**Multiple leases:** Create a separate capsule per lease. Use the "Lease Accounting (IFRS 16)" capsule type for all. Tags and nano classifiers can span multiple capsules for portfolio reporting.

**Lease incentives:** If the landlord provides a $10,000 fit-out allowance, reduce the ROU asset: PV of payments − incentive = initial ROU value. Adjust the amortization table accordingly.
