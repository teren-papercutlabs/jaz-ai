  - **Cancelled tab:** Lists organizations that were manually cancelled or automatically ended after the reinstatement period lapsed following a downgrade, and is no longer eligible for reinstatement.**Q5. How do I manually downgrade and cancel a subscription?**

- Before downgrading or canceling an organization, keep the following in mind:
  - Cancelling does not immediately remove access.
  - Billing cycles do not reset when a subscription is cancelled.
  - No refunds or credits are issued for unused time. Check our terms and conditions [here](https://www.jaz.ai/legal).
  - Cancelling only affects future renewals, not the current billing period.
- After selecting an organization go to **Settings > Plans & Add-ons > Manage Plan**
- Choose the downgraded plan, such as Essentials to Free, Growth to Essentials, or Growth to Free. After confirming, a downgrade schedule confirmation will appear.

**Q6. If I cancel a subscription, will it reset my billing cycle?**

- No. Cancelling a subscription does not reset the current billing cycle. Example**:**
  - A monthly subscription starts on January 1 and runs until January 30, renewing on February 1 at 00:00.

**Q7. How do I transfer billing of my organization to another billing account?**

- Go to **Plans & Add-ons** and select**Manage**.
- During checkout, choose a different billing account to pay for the subscription.

**Q8. Can I share my billing account with another member of the organization?**

- Yes. You can share your billing account with another user by granting them billing access. Go to **Settings > Access Management**.
- Select an admin member of your organization and under Organization Permissions enable **Plans & Add-ons** access.**Q9. What happens if my billing account balance runs out?**

- If your billing account does not have enough balance, your organizations will downgrade on their due date.
- If the recharge funds are not enough to cover the total amount due, **no organizations will be charged and all will be downgraded**, since billing is processed as a single payment. Example:
  - Balance: S$3,000
  - Total due: S$4,000 (Org A: S$2,000, Org B: S$2,000)
  - Result: Payment fails and both organizations are downgraded.
- To prevent your organizations from being downgraded, make sure to turn on [auto-recharge](https://help.jaz.ai/en/articles/11710444-billing-account-setup). You will also receive a notice to recharge a few days prior to your due date to remind you of the upcoming billing.

- Only users with the appropriate billing or administrative permissions can manage organization subscriptions.

**Q11. What happens to my data if an organization is downgraded or cancelled?**

- Organization data is preserved during downgrade or cancellation.

- Include the following details:
  - Subject as “Request to transfer credits”
  - Source billing account email and name
  - Amount of credits to transfer

### Re-instating your Org's Subscription
Source: https://help.jaz.ai/en/articles/13368779-re-instating-your-org-s-subscription

**Q1. Why was my organization downgraded?**

- This happens due to unpaid subscriptions caused by insufficient funds.
- **Note:** Other cancellation reasons, such as user-initiated downgrades, cannot be reinstated.**Q2. When does this happen?**

- Organizations automatically downgrade at midnight on the due date. For example, if payment is due on September 1, the downgrade occurs at 00:00 on September 1.

**Q3. If I reinstate my subscription later, will my subscription date reset?**

- No. The subscription date remains the same. For example, if downgraded on September 1 and reinstated on September 5, the next due date is still October 1.

**Q4. How do I reinstate my subscriptions?**

- Go to **Settings > Billing Accounts > Choose Billing Account > Organization Plans Tab > Downgraded**. Select the organizations to reinstate and ensure you have enough balance.
- **Note:** Reinstatement is available only within 28 days from the downgrade date. After this, you cannot reinstate the subscription.**Q5. How can I prevent my organizations from being downgraded?**

- It is highly recommended to save a credit card as a payment method and enable **Auto Recharge** so your balance tops up before the due date. This removes the need for manual top-ups.
- It’s also best practice to add at least two payment methods to ensure a backup if the default fails.
